The CAF **Agent of the Week**  (AotW) is an exemplary agentic application or individual agent that demonstrates superior architecture, use of common tools, and scientific impact. This much-sought-after recognition brings, on occasion, a free drink and a CAF hat for the winning team--but the true joy in winning is the glory that comes from recognition by your peers. Needless to say, many aspire to win, but few are chosen.
