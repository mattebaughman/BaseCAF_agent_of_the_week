The CAF **Agent of the Week**  (AotW) is an exemplary agentic application or individual agent that demonstrates superior architecture, use of common tools, and scientific impact. This much-sought-after recognition brings, on occasion, a free drink and a CAF hat for the winning team--but the true joy in winning is the glory that comes from recognition by your peers. Needless to say, many aspire to win, but few are chosen.

## How to become an Agent of the Week

To submit an Agent of the Weel description, you only need to fill a Markdown template hosted as part of this GitHub repository. The preferred way to submit your agent description is via creating a pull request with your own Markdown file. To this end, these are the recommended steps for submitting your Agent of the Week description:

Fork the *BaseCAF_agent_of_the_week* GitHub repository.

Clone your forked repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/BaseCAF_agent_of_the_week.git
```

Copy the *AoTW-template.md* file into a new file named *AotW#<current_highest_AoTW_number+1>-<your_project_name>.md* and fill this file following the instructions from the template.

Add and commit this file to the repository.

```
git add -A && git commit -m "New Agent of the Week" 
```

Then, create a Pull Request for the Ai-ModCon GitHub repository.

The CAF team will then evaluate your pull request, and merge the changes if your Agent of the Week is properly described.
